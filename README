Whats is tweetbot?
Just another configurable twitter bot written in Python

Why was it created?
Due to workpressure and general lethargy, tweeting may start to feel more like a chore.
Tweetbot was created to take this burden away from you, this is a configurable bot which allows you to specify a list of topic which interests you.
Then the bot reaches out to "HackerNews" to fetch the top news, filter out the topics of interests and tweet them out, even creating appropriate "Hashtags" to be attached.
The bot also uses url shortening service provided by Bitly to make sure the tweet remains under the specified character limit on twitter.

Limitations:
- Currently only news source available is HackerNews, and is tightly integrated in the codebase.
- News is fetched once a day, is configurable.
- Can only tweet on your account, integration of stream for active listening of your twitter feed is not available.

How to use?

- Prerequisits:
  - Python 3.x (tested on python 3.7.x and 3.9)
  - Pip for installation of third party libraries
  - Third party packages like hackernews, bitlyshortner, scheduler etc
  - Virtualenv (I use virtualenv wrapper personally)
- Clone the repo

Near term:

1. Twitter integration
2. Set list of topics
3. Retweet tweets tagged with that topic every 30 mins
4. Read data from hackernews, based on ame topics of interest list
5. Shorten url of these topics and tweet every hour

Long term:

1. follow back users who followed you
2. check list of followers if somebody unfollows you, unfollow them back (will have to chekc feasibility)
3. read tweets addressed to account and reply back based on NLP (use GPT 3 or some middleware from amazom/google)
